Hello! I am a senior undergraduate student major in Statistics & Computer Science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I am currently working as an undergraduate research assistant in [CS@Illinois Computer Vision Group](https://vision.cs.illinois.edu/vision_website/), supervised by Prof. [Derek Hoiem](https://dhoiem.cs.illinois.edu/). Besides, I am also an undergraduate research assistant in [CyPhy Group](https://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/teaching.html), supervised by Prof. [Tarek Abdelazher](https://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/index.html).

My research interests mainly focus on computer vision and graph neural network, especially in explainable artificial intelligence, dynamic link prediction, incremental few-shot learning, and robust graph learning.
