Hello! I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I'm actively engaged in research at [WAVLab](https://www.wavlab.org/) under the guidance of Prof. [Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe). My primary research areas include Multimodal Language Models, Multimodal Fusion, Speech Recognition, AVSR, and Speech Translation.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant in the [CyPhy Group](https://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/teaching.html), supervised by Prof. [Tarek Abdelazher](https://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/index.html). Additionally, I gained valuable experience collaborating with Prof. [Kris Hauser](https://kkhauser.web.illinois.edu/) and Prof. [Yuxiong Wang](https://yxw.web.illinois.edu/) in the [Intelligent Motion Lab](https://motion.cs.illinois.edu/index.html).

My research interests are centered around **Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLM)** and **Multimodal Fusion**, with a particular focus on integrating speech and visual modalities.
